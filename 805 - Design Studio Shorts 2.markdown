# 805 - Design Studio Shorts 2

## What's new in iOS 11

- Digital environments can benefit from clear navigation.
- Highlight content first.
- Layouts with clear hierarchy.
- UI elements should not compete with content.

- iOS 11 focus
  - Wayfinding
  - Typographic Hierarchy
  - Contrast
  
- Large titles are helpful as you navigate further into the app (Music as example)
- Phone in iOS 11
- User large titles purposefully
  - Clock app. No navigation, each tab has a different layout.
  
- Typographic hierarchy
  - Position of the text can convey importance.
  - Size, weight and colors. May need to use more than one at a time.

- Contrast
  - Fill button shapes.
  - Increase the size of the field itself.
  - Updated tabbars from regular to medium
  - Filled glyphs.
  - Horizontal tabbar with texts by the side. Glyphs are smaller, bar is shorter.

## Size classes

- Use size classes.
- Use dynamic type.
  - Readability margins.
- Take advantage of standard UIKit elements.
  - Free app from redesigning or rebuilding things that people are already familiar with.

## Rich notifications

- Be mindful of people's time.
  - Only send notifications when they are relevant.
  - Be clear why they are needed when asking for notifications.
- Should be a self contained package of information that allows user to complete a task.
  - Should not require users to open the app.

## Designing glyphs

- Monochromatic and should be colorised programatically.

- Effective glyphs characteristics
  - Simplified form
  - Universal symbology
  - Quick to read
  
- Optical weight
- Lines
- Positioning
  - Applies to almost any asset that is asymetrical.
  - Bake the spacing on the glyph, so they can easily be centered in the app, as any other.
  
- Simplify and think globally (example of delicious with different foods vs heart)
- Build them as sets
- Test them in context
- Preview them on device

## How to choose a custom font

- Functionality. What is my intended use?
- Style. What impression do I want to make?
- Pairing

- Contrast
  - Difference in weight between different strokes.
  - High contrast looks nice on display
  - Lower contrast can be used on smaller sizes, easier to read.
  
- Pairing
  - No rule against use more than two, but better start small.
  - Pick fonts because of the match, not their name.
  - Consistent Proportions. At the same point size, two fonts might appear to be a different size.
